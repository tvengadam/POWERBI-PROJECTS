Project Title: Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard

This project aims to develop a Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard to provide key business insights. It will analyse total sales, orders, and quantities sold monthly, highlighting trends and month-over-month differences. Interactive visuals include a calendar heat map for daily sales, sales comparisons between weekends and weekdays, and location-based performance tracking. A daily sales line chart with an average benchmark will identify outliers, while a top 10 products chart will showcase the best-selling items. The dashboard will empower decision-making through clear, data-driven visuals and metrics.
